Colly is a Golang framework for building web scrapers. With Colly you can build web scrapers of various complexity, from simple scraper to complex asynchronous website crawlers processing millions of web pages. Colly provides an API for performing network requests and for handling the received content (e.g. interacting with DOM tree of the HTML document).
